
# Vue Smooth Reflow (VSR)

A Vue mixin that transitions reflow.

When the component's data is changed, any CSS properties that you register will transition to its new value.

Common use cases are:

* Transitioning `height: auto` and `width: auto`.
* Smoothly repositioning elements.

Note that this library has no overlap with Vue's built in `<transition>` components.

## API

`$smoothReflow(options)`

Enables smooth reflow on an element. This method is available on the component instance.

`options` can be an object, or an array of objects.

#### Options reference

* `el`

    Type: `Element | String`

    Default: The components root element.

    An element reference, or a CSS selector string. The resolved element will transition reflows on registered properties. This element is referred to as the "smooth element".

    Use a selector string if the element is not rendered initially, like if it's hidden with `v-if`. If the selector returns multiple elements, the first one will be used.

* `property`

    Type: `String | Array`

    Default: `height`

    Valid values: `height`, `width`, `transform`

    The CSS property(s) that you want to transition. You can pass any combination.

    For `transform`, VSR will only transition the `translate()` function. This is to handle element repositioning due to reflow.

* `transition`

    Type: `String`

    Default: `height .5s`

    A valid CSS transition value. If you register multiple properties, and want different transitions for each, you can use commas.

    ```javascript
    this.$smoothReflow({
        property: ['height', 'width'],
        transition: 'height .25s ease-in-out, width .75s ease-out'
    })
    ```
    The default value is conditional on the `property` option.

    For example, if you register `height` and `transform` like so:

    ```javascript
    this.$smoothReflow({
        property: ['height', 'transform']
    })
    ```

    The default value will become `height .5s, transform .5s`.

    If the smooth element has transitions on other properties like `background-color`, they will be preserved.

    NOTE: Any transitions defined as an inline style on the smooth element will be ignored and erased.

* `transitionEvent`

    Type: `Object`

    Default: `null`

    Valid values:
    ``` javascript
    transitionEvent: {
        // Any valid CSS selector. Note that comma delimited selectors are valid.
        selector: String,
        // Any valid CSS property name.
        propertyName: String
    }
    ```

    Configures the smooth element to react to `transitionend` events that are emitted by other elements. You must opt-in for this behavior, there is no default.

    `selector` and `propertyName` serve as filters so that the smooth element doesn't cause reflows for every `transitionend` event that it catches, which impacts performance. When the smooth element receives a `transitionend` event, it will check if `selector` matches `event.target`, and/or if `propertyName` matches `event.propertyName`. You can specify one or the other, or both. All checks must pass in order for the smooth element to proceed with the smooth reflow.

    A common use case is to delay the smooth reflow until after a child element has been transitioned out with `v-if/v-show` and `<transition>`.

    For example, if you want to react to any child `div` elements that transition out with opacity, use this config:

    ``` javascript
    transitionEvent: {
        selector: 'div',
        propertyName: 'opacity'
    }
    ```

    Let's say you want to transition the smooth element's position. You want to wait for an element with class `.i-cause-reflow` to transition out before performing the smooth reflow. This element can be located anywhere within the component. Here's the configuration for that:

    ``` javascript
    transitionEvent: {
        selector: '.i-cause-reflow',
    }
    ```

    Check out the demo for more examples.

* `hideOverflow`

    Type: `Boolean`

    Default: `true`

    Hides overflow during the transition.

    This has 2 benefits. It prevents the scrollbar from appearing, and will hide child elements that overflow.


`$unsmoothReflow(options)`

Disables smooth reflow on an element. This method is available on the component instance.

`options` can be an object, or an array of objects.

Registered elements that have the same `el` as the passed in options will be unregistered. This usually isn't necessary, but is useful if you want to disable the behavior while the component is still alive.

## Smooth Component

Importing VSR into every component that needs it violates DRY. Instead, you can create one component that imports VSR then use it as needed. This should satisfy 90% of use cases.

Example:

```js
// SmoothReflow.vue
<template>
    <component :is="tag">
        <slot/>
    </component>
</template>

<script>
import smoothReflow from 'vue-smooth-reflow'
export default {
    name: 'SmoothReflow',
    mixins: [smoothReflow],
    props: {
        tag: {
            type: String,
            default: 'div'
        },
        options: Object,
    },
    mounted () {
        this.$smoothReflow(this.options)
    }
}
</script>

```

Globally register this component for convenience.

```js
// main.js
import SmoothReflow from './components/SmoothReflow'

Vue.component('SmoothReflow', SmoothReflow)
```

Update your existing components that import VSR. This is a modification of the first [usage example](#usage). Goodbye boilerplate!

```diff
<template>
    <SmoothReflow>
        <div v-for="n in children"/>
    </SmoothReflow>
</template>

<script>
-import smoothReflow from 'vue-smooth-reflow'
export default {
-   mixins: [smoothReflow],
    data() {
        return {
            children: '<Dynamic value>'
        }
    },
-    mounted(){
-        this.$smoothReflow()
-    },
}
</script>
```

You may run into reactivity issues when using the `SmoothComponent`. VSR hooks into the component's `beforeUpdate` and `updated` lifecycle methods, so if those are never called, then the transition won't occur.

## Examples:

```javascript
mounted(){
    // Zero config. Enables smooth reflow on this.$el
    this.$smoothReflow()
    // Register with element reference
    this.$smoothReflow({
        el: this.$refs.wrapper,
    })
    // Register with classname. The first match will be used.
    this.$smoothReflow({
        el: '.wrapper-2',
    })
    // Pass an array of options
    this.$smoothReflow([
        // Wait for .reflow-causer to emit a transitionend event,
        // then transition the smooth element's position
        {
            el: this.$refs.wrapper,
            property: 'transform',
            transitionEvent: {
                selector: '.reflow-causer'
            }
        },
        // Wait for a transitionend event for opacity that
        // comes from the smooth elements descendants,
        // then transition the smooth elements height and width.
        {
            el: '.wrapper-2',
            property: ['height', 'width'],
            transitionEvent: {
                propertyName: 'opacity'
            }
        },
    ])
    // If the element reference is a component,
    // make sure to pass in its "$el" property.
    this.$smoothReflow({
        el: this.$refs.wrapper.$el,
    })
    // Unregister a smooth element that would match
    // the selector '.wrapper-5'
    this.$unsmoothReflow({
        el: '.wrapper-5'
    })
}
</script>

```

### Differences from vue-smooth-height

* Enables smooth reflows on `width` and `transform`.

* VSR will no longer check for existing transition values for registered properties. It will only use the value of the `transition` option.

* The `hideOverflow` option now defaults to `true`.

* The way child transitions are handled is completely different.
